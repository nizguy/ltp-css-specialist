        <p class="poem">
        	Once upon a midnight dreary, While I 
        	pondered, weak and weary,
        	Over many a quaint and curious volume
        	of forgottenlore--
        	While I nodded, nearly napping,
        	suddenly there came a tapping,
        	as  of someone gently rapping, rapping
        	at my chamber door.
        	" 'Tis some visitor," I muttered,
        	"tapping at my chamber door--
        	Only this and nothing more."
